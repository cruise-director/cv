        <p>I first started creating websites in 1997. My first attempt was for my soon to be wife. She wanted me to create a real estate website for her real estate business.
          I used a software program by Microsoft entitled <e>Microsoft FrontPage</e>. I really enjoyed the coding process, but the software was limiting so I learned had to code "old school".
          Since 1997 I have created numerous websites for family friends and different businesses. My wife and I love to go on cruises and are considering buying an RV
          and traveling across the country to see all that it has to offer.</p>
